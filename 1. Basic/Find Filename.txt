Get-ChildItem -Path 'C:\mypath\' -Recurse -Include *.txt
Get-ChildItem -Path 'C:\mypath\' -Recurse -Include '*.tar*' -Exclude '*.gz*'

Get-ChildItem -Path 'C:\mypath\' -Recurse -Filter '*.docx*' 


◉ Difference between -Include and -Filter
	‣ Filter parameter is implemented by provider. It is efficient because applies when 
		retrieving the objects. Get-PSprovider commandlet shows providers that implement 
		'filter' parameter. For example, there are only two providers on my system:ActiveDirectory 
		and FileSystem
	‣ Include parameter is implemented by Powershell. It only works in conjunction with Recurse
		parameter (as MSDN describes here).
