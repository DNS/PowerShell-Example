DIFFERENCES:

# >
'>' Has limitation.
Can't decide what encoding to use.
It will cut lines same way they are displayed.
Out-File has -Width parameter that helps you avoid this.

# Read and write locking
While Out-File is running, another application can read the log file.
While Set-Content is running, other applications cannot read the log file. Thus never use Set-Content to log long running commands.

# Encoding (default, but can be overide)
Out-File saves in Unicode (UTF-16LE)
Set-Content saves in ASCII (US-ASCII)

# Formatting
Out-File saves the fancy formatting of the output, as seen in the terminal.
Set-Content saves a simpler representation.
