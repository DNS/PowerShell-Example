
Get-Process
Start-Process
Stop-Process
Wait-Process

Normally, for internal commands PowerShell does wait before starting the next command. One exception to this rule is external Windows subsystem based EXE. The first trick is to pipeline to Out-Null like so:

Notepad.exe | Out-Null

Start-Process -Wait
Stop-Process


---------------------------
# Start a background job
Start-Job -FilePath C:\Scripts\Sample.ps1
Start-Job -ScriptBlock { notepad.exe }

Get-Job
Get-Job | Stop-Job
Get-Job | Remove-Job

# Use the background operator to start a background job
Get-Process -Name pwsh &

# Start a job using Invoke-Command
Invoke-Command
