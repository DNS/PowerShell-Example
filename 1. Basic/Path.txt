-Path <string[]>
Wildcards are permitted. If the path includes spaces, enclose it in quotation marks.

-LiteralPath <string[]>
Unlike Path, the value of LiteralPath is used exactly as it is typed. No characters are interpreted as wildcards. If the path includes escape characters, enclose it in single quotation marks. Single quotation marks tell Windows PowerShell not to interpret any characters as escape sequences.
