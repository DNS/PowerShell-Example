
-InputObject 

-InputObject is, by convention, a generic parameter name for what should 
be considered to be pipeline input.

When you pipe multiple objects to a command, PowerShell sends the objects 
to the command one at a time. When you use a command parameter, the objects 
are sent as a single array object. This minor difference has significant 
consequences.

The cmdlet does not unroll -InputObject itself, the data is delivered 
one element at a time. This is why you might see problems when passing a 
collection to the -InputObject parameter directly - because the cmdlet is 
probably not designed to unroll a collection itself, it expects each 
collection element to be handed to it in a piecemeal fashion.


# Example:
$b = @(1, 2, 3)
ForEach-Object -InputObject $b { Write-Host "Start $_ End" }

# Compared with:
$b = @(1, 2, 3)
$b | ForEach-Object { Write-Host "Start $_ End" }


For the vast majority of cmdlets, direct use of the -InputObject parameter 
is indeed pointless.
